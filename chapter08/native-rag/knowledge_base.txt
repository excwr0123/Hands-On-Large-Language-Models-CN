RAG 的的本质是：增强 System Prompt 的上下文，从而生成更符合实际要求的回复。
RAG is a technique called Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which improves AI models by having them retrieve information from an external knowledge base before generating a response. 
This allows the AI to access current, private, or specialized data beyond its original training set, making its answers more accurate, relevant, and trustworthy. 
Instead of just recalling its pre-trained data, the AI uses the retrieved information to "augment" or enhance its response.  
Retrieval: When a user asks a question, the RAG system first searches an external, up-to-date knowledge base for the most relevant information. 
Augmentation: The retrieved data is then added to the original user prompt, providing the AI with specific, contextual information. 
Generation: The AI model generates a response based on this augmented prompt, which is now grounded in the external, factual data.
